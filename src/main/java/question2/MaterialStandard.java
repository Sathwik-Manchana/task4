/**
 * Construction cost per square feet is
 *
 * • 1200INR if we use standard materials
 * • 1500INR if we use above standard materials
 * • 1800INR if customers needs high standard material
 * • 2500INR if customer needs high standard material and fully
 * automated home
 * • Input will be material standard, total area of house and if they want
 * fully automated home
 *
 *
 *  NOTE: Ceartainly EPAM gives confusing Question if user wants to have rest materials other than high quality and fully automated
 *  Should we give a cost of 2500-1800 = 700 INR per square feet quote (Automated House) or simply not possible a better clarification is needed
 *  I go with Simply not possible Cases as this approach is non-intelligent machine achievable. (*_*)
